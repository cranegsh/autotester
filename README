Auto Tester application

dev dependency (needed for building this project): PCAN package libraries and headers.
run dependency (needed for runningt this application): PCAN package driver and shared libraries, actually only libpcanbasic.so.

Usually they are not supposed to be placed together with the source files of this application as it is confusing to do so and not a good practice for project source control!
It is for backup and convenience to place these libraries together with source files, in a separate folder.

They are supposed to copied to /usr/lib and /use/include unser sysroot folder when being used to compile this project.
It might also work to keep them in where they are now and add searching path in Makefile when being used in compiling this project.
